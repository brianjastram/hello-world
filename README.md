# hello-world
Getting started on this new project here at the MWMO (Mississippi Watershed Management Organization). I'm working to build remote water quality stations that will provide river water quality data in 5 minute intervals to our WISKI database. So far I've got some experience blinking lights on the Mayfly board connecting a sensor and troubleshooting cell and WiFi modems.

Getting Started
Here at the MWMO (Mississippi Watershed Management Organization) I'm working to build remote water quality stations that will provide river water quality data in 5 minute intervals to our WISKI database. So far I've got some experience blinking lights on the Mayfly board and troubleshooting cell and WiFi modems.
